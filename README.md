# AutoDND


Just a simple tool to turn on/off DND(Do Not Disturb) automatically when using specified apps.

---

Ever feel disturbed by notifications and maybe phone calls during gameplays?

This app could be your savior! It uses Android accessibility service to be aware of the current app that you're using, and turn on DND automatically, now you don't have to toggle DND by yourself every time you want to be undisturbed!

---

Usage: Grant necessary permission (Just tap on the floating button), and add your apps from "ALL APPS" tab.


## To-dos:

1. Better mechanism to make sure DND turns on/off only on expected conditions
